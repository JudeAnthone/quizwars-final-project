ORDER OF CODING

Question.java
- Start with the base class. It provides the foundation for all questions, containing shared properties and methods.
This ensures you can easily build subclasses like EasyQuestion, MediumQuestion, and HardQuestion.

EasyQuestion.java, MediumQuestion.java, and HardQuestion.java
- Create these subclasses next. They extend Question and implement the specific details for each difficulty.
These are essential for loading and handling different types of questions.

QuestionLoader.java
- Once the question classes are ready, focus on this utility class. It will load questions from the files based on the difficulty level.
You can test it separately by calling loadQuestions() with mock data or a simple main method.

Main.java
- Write the Main class last. It brings everything together by invoking QuestionLoader, displaying questions, and interacting with the user.
This class relies on the other components being ready and functional.
